# Tick my route
## Bouldering WebApp
A webapp to track my bouldering based on SvelteKit, Express, Node.js, Tailwind CSS &amp; MongoDB 


# Sources & Inspiration 
This is my first Svelte project which I mostly use as a way to get way to get familiar with Sveltekit & Tailwind CSS. Besides that, it's supposed to solve my problem of tracking progress of climbing & bouldering in different indoor locations with different route scales. 

I combine tutorial sources with my own ideas to create this: 
- Header & usage of Tailwind CSS in "SvelteKit Crash Course - SSR, API Routes, Stores, Tailwind CSS, and More!" | https://github.com/jamesqquick/svelte-kit-pokedex / https://youtu.be/UU7MgYIbtAk?t=1524
- Express/Node.js backend in "Svelte tutorial : Full stack svelte [1/2] Mongo, express and node js" | https://github.com/3stbn/full-stack-svelte-expenses-tracker / https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6J41F2DadQ&list=WL&index=83&t=3778s
